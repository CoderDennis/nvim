# nvim
my neovim config (~/.config/nvim)

I don't remember for sure if [this is the exact blog post](https://www.smoothterminal.com/articles/neovim-for-elixir), 
but I know it was one from Josh Adams about how he configures neovim for working with Elixir that helped me with initially 
getting started running neovim.

See links within comments throughout for sources of some of the settings. 

I have split up the config into a couple different files so that the neovim specific stuff is isolated and I can use 
`keys.vim` inside vim plugins for IDE's and other text editors.

A former coworker gave me the trick of mapping `jj` to `Esc`.
